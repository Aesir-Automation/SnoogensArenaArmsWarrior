# Snoogens Arena Arms Warrior v1.0

A PVP only rotation bringing all the nifty features that you’ve already seen and building upon it!  
Special thanks to @Vid for supplying such a great foundation for Arms Warrior PVP - without it I wouldn't have learned all this.

## More to come, based on your feedback!  
Please provide me (in PM, preferably) with your direct feedback. A feature not working as you expect? Rotation not performing what you believe is optimal? Anything!

## To be looked into:  
Auto Stormbolt and Intimidating Shout Options  
•	Automatically Stormbolt or Intimidating Shouts any healer to extend a CC Chain  
•	Automatically Stormbolts or Intimidating Shouts any DPS with cooldowns running  
Diminishing Returns Tracker!  
•	Don’t throw CCs if target is immune!  
Don’t hit breakable CC!  
•	Tired of breaking your team mates CC?  
Disarm without target!  
•	Too lazy to target the Warrior who just popped Avatar?  
Auto Piercing Howl when target isn't in range and Hamstring isn't applied!  
•	Not sure, but could be neat if you're lazy I guess?  
Burst Rotation tweaks
• I'm not sure if it's optimal yet, I think we can do better!

## Disclaimer:  
I can't help you with Aimsharp client issues. If your Aimsharp doesn't work, please fix that first.  
Auto Spell Reflection is what it is - i.e. you can never really know if a spell is being cast on you unless they target you (i.e. don't use mouseover macros etc), so it doesn't catch all - but some atleast!   
Disarm is only for Avatar at the moment, perhaps should add Avenging Wrath too? Not sure how good it's against Rets.  
Forgot to add Ice Block to Auto Shattering Throw, woopsie - next version!
