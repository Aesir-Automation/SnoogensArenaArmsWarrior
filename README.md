# Snoogens Arena Arms Warrior v1.6 
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/m4bFPVJ.jpg)  

A PVP only rotation bringing all the nifty features that you’ve already seen and building upon it!  
Special thanks to @Vid for supplying such a great foundation for Arms Warrior PVP - without it I wouldn't have learned all this.  

Unzip and place the `Snoogens-Arena-Arms-Warrior` folder under your Aimsharp Rotations folder, e.g. `X:\AimsharpFolder\Bin\Rotations`  

I recommend using this rotation together with Aimsharp's ArenaPVP Kicks plugin.

## Disclaimer:  
I can't help you with Aimsharp client issues. If your Aimsharp doesn't work, please fix that first.  
Auto Spell Reflection is what it is - i.e. you can never really know if a spell is being cast on you unless they target you (i.e. don't use mouseover macros etc), so it doesn't catch all - but some atleast!  
Auto Retarget Feign Death is not working most of the time, trying to find a better solution.  

## Advanced Users:  
You can use WeakAuras to see what you've toggled on, helps to realize if you've kept Burst on but forgot about it.
Here's an example for Burst.

Import this WeakAura and modify your Burst Toggle macro to look like this:  
`/xxxxx Burst`  
`/run local cvar="Burst" SetCVar(cvar,1-GetCVar(cvar),cvar)`  
It will now toggle an Icon on your screen for when Burst is active.  
Keep in mind that the WeakAura can get "out of sync" if you restart the rotation with this being active etc.
