# Snoogens Arena Arms Warrior v2.0  
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/b3Ml4wj.png)  

A PVP only rotation with a specific focus on Arena, however with support for Battleground usage.  
Only compatible with English Language World of Warcraft Client. This means that this rotation won't work for WoW clients with German, Russian etc languages.  
Purchase a license through https://shoppy.gg/@snoogens  
Discord: https://discord.gg/VksJWWk9PS  
Unzip and place the Snoogens-Arena-Arms-Warrior folder under your Aimsharp Rotations folder, e.g. X:\AimsharpFolder\Bin\Rotations  
Place the license.txt file you've recieved by email after purchasing in the Snoogens-Arena-Arms-Warrior folder.  
I recommend using this rotation together with Aimsharp's ArenaPVP Kicks plugin.
